IDE Support
===========

The following supported Sphinx-Needs language features are intergrated into `Esbonio language server <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio>`_.

.. note::

   Currently as long as needs.json exists under {confdir}/_build/needs in your sphinx needs project, all the features are available
   if your IDE extension or plugin supports `Esbonio language server <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio>`_.


To use all the Sphinx-Needs language featues,

* Install IDE extension or plugin, see current supported IDE extension in :ref:`ide_installation`.

* Build needs.json file under path {confdir}/_build/needs in your Sphinx-Needs project, see how to build needs.json in :ref:`builders`.
